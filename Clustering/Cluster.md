Microsoft.FailoverClusters.PowerShell
This reference provides cmdlet descriptions and syntax for all failover cluster-specific cmdlets in Windows PowerShell in Windows Server® 2008 R2. It lists the cmdlets in alphabetical order based on the verb at the beginning of the cmdlet. For a list of cmdlets in alphabetical order by task focus, that is, by the noun at the end of the cmdlet, see Failover Cluster Cmdlets in Windows PowerShell Listed by Task Focus (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=162164).
The Windows PowerShell cmdlets provide an alternative interface for actions that you might otherwise perform with command-line commands or the Failover Cluster Manager snap-in. For more information about using Windows PowerShell, see "Additional references," later in this topic.
